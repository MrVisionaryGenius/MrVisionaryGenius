I build, deploy, and iterate real-world software systems, **especially AI-powered ones****,** under real business constraints.

As a **Forward Deployed Engineer,** I work at the intersection of business problems, engineering, and deployment. My role is not just to write code or train models, but to translate unclear requirements into working systems that run in production and deliver measurable outcomes.
**I work end-to-end across the stack:**• Understanding business problems and constraints• Designing AI-driven solutions where they actually make sense• Building backend APIs and data pipelines• Creating frontends that users can trust and adopt• Deploying, securing, and operating systems on cloud platforms• Iterating quickly based on real user feedback

My background spans AI/ML, backend development, frontend engineering, and cloud deployments. I’ve spent a lot of time turning prototypes into production-ready solutions — dealing with latency, cost, security, scalability, and usability, not just **“what works in a demo.”****I’m especially interested in how technology supports business strategy:**Why a simpler model can outperform a complex one.Why UX decisions often matter more than algorithms.Why deployment and operations decide whether a product succeeds.If you’re building software or AI systems and need someone who can own the full lifecycle, from problem definition to production “I’m always open to conversations.”
